# NOFC - Beta NOLO OSVR Fusion Configuration

This repository will hold the latest binary distributions (or links to the latest binary distributions) of a Beta Nolo OSVR Fusion Configuration (johnlajoie version).  If you are looking for the #official# NOFC repository by @nanospork, you can find it [here](https://github.com/nanospork/NOFC). 

This repository is not intended to supplant the official repository by @nanospork, but instead it provides me a way to roll up and make available for testing changes and new features before they are merged into the official NOFC. 

## Downloading and Installing

Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/johnlajoie/NOFC/release) section, then follow the included installation instructions.

## Bug Reporting and Issues

Please also __report any issues with the Nolo OSVR Fusion Configuration in the [Issues](https://github.com/johnlajoie/NOFC/issues) tab.__

The NOFC is made up of four key components, which may be forked from the original. The following are links to the most current branch of each component used by NOFC:
